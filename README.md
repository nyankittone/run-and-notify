# Run a shell script. Get notified of how it ran.

`run-and-notify` is a program that runs an arbitrary command, and then afterwards, displays the
result of that command via a desktop notification. It can be configured to display various things,
such as the program's standard output and error, or its exit code in the notification.

Ever used a window manager on Linux, try to open an app of some kind, and have it do nothing, with
no visual feedback? Wouldn't it be nice to have a notification pop up saying the thing you tried to run
succeeded or failed so you don't have to pop to the terminal and try running the spp from there? That's
what this program is supposed to solve; provide a way for users to get *actual* feedback on stuff
like this.

# Work in Progress!!!
This program is still is development of its core features. It is currently not in a functional
state. I'm hoping I will get that changed soon, though! :3
